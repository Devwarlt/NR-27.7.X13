# NR-27.7.X13

This client is based off Realm of the Mad God's 27.7.X13 client. At the time of this commit, it is the pure client with no modifications.

I took the robotlegs, swiftsuspenders, and hamcrest libraries from @kaos00723's version of the [27.7.X2 client](https://github.com/kaos00723/RotMG_Client_27.7.X2). So a special thanks to him for that. :relieved:
